# Hello World!

## To do list : README

### Why this program ?
I began this project because I am a huge fan of pro clubs, which is my favorite mode on EA SPORTS FC24. I was playing with my friends and thought about creating a program useful for pro clubs. My goal is also to develope it as a discord bot. The project is in progress and I want to update and improve it every week/month. It's my first non-school project, I hope you will be cool about it.

### What can you do with this program ? (futures features are bolder)
* Setup your own team
* See the statistics of your club but also of all your players
* Choose the statistics you want to see (you have a guide when you use this feature)
* Compare players (more features about it are coming soon)
* Create tactical systems
* Manage your team (add and remove player with many data and it automaticly set him on the team)
* **Generate an image of your team system on the field**
* **Analyze ten last games statistics**
* **Optimization of programs (especially tactics)**
* **Use it on discord**

### License
